To get it running:
Create a new project in Eclipse
Once project created, copy all files into project directory ( ok to overwrite src and bin dir's )
Download the latest Junit and place into /lib folder
Right click on project > Properties > Java Build Path > Libraries > Add Jars. Add the all 4 jars in the /lib folder
I had 3 permissions errors but resolved them by loosening permissions from default and protected to public
I had 2 type mismatch errors: cannot convert from boolean to char. I am currently stuck here and not sure how to resolve.
